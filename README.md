# MedianCut
Median Cut Algorithm takes and image with 24 bits/pixels and converts it to an image with 8 bits/pixel.
It takes an image and finds out the most used 256 colours and creates a Look Up table. This LUT is used to replace each pixel of the orignal image with the nearest colour from the most used 256 colours.
